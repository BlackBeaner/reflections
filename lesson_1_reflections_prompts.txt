* How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you
a more efficent programmer in the long term?
- We could use a version control system to save all changes (versions) 
we made.

* What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to 
create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically 
saved, like Google Docs does?
- I think it will not be manually saved.

* Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat 
each file separately?
- I will work on multiple files at the same time, so saving one file in
one commit makes commit too small.

* How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history
of files?
- I just use the command "git log --stat" to des file in order to view
all commits, then use the command "git diff commit1 commit2" to compare
2 commit each others.

* How might using version control make you more confident to make 
changes that could break something?
- I can see all version, but don't break anything.

* Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try 
using Git for?
- for my projects.
