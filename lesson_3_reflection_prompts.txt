* When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?
-  I use a remote repository whenever I want to share my changes to 
co-worker.

* Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Maybe it's got some changes on GitHub I don't want to pull back. 

* What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the
remote stored locally?
- It give the option of choosing to merge co-worker's branch on github
and local branch or not.

* How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be 
easier, and what would be harder?
- I'll use an other vcs or collaborate directly by email.
