* When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping 
all your work local?
-  I use a remote repository whenever I want to share my changes to 
co-worker.

* Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than 
having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Maybe it's got some changes on GitHub I don't want to pull back. 

* Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of another?
- Forks are a copied version of origin on GitHub have no effect on 
origin. Clones are a copied version of origin pulled back local 
repository. Branches are squence of commits forked from origin branch.
